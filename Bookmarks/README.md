Installing a bookmarklet is simple
First find the code for it (It normally starts with javascript:....)
Second Copy that code, 
Third we need to see the bookmarks so press ctrl+shift+b and then you should see a bookmark bar if not look around a bit to show bookmark bar or something.
Fourth right click the bar on an empty spot and add a new page or site set the name as whatever and then click set or okay.
Finally right click the bookmark and then under url delete what is there and paste what you copied press save or okay and then boom.
